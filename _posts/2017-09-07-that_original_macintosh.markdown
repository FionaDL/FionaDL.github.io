I still remember the first time I saw a computer in someone's home. I was six, and visiting my friend Kate. She led me into her father's off-limits office. On the table was a Macintosh computer with its brightly colored rainbow apple, and its keyboard begging to be touched. She showed me how to turn it on, we stared at the dimly lit screen in awe. 
	When I got home that night I told my father all about it, and he told me that he had been thinking about getting one. A few months later a computer entered out home, and was sent up to the third floor attic room. I was scared of the third floor, but I braved it often to go up and turn the computer on. I played around with typing and drawing, but my true love was Shufflepuck Café. I spent countless hours playing against the various characters, my sister and I jostling each other for turns. 
	The years passed by, our computer was updated again and again; I fell in love with Oregon Trail, Myst, and then America Online. Everything about computers was fascinating. Using them to edit videos in high school, talking with people all over the world in chat rooms, email, the horrible years of pop-up ads, Facebook added my senior year of college, and finally several forays into webpage building through wordpress. 
	Meanwhile I studied anthropology in college, and then moved to Italy to study cooking. I became a cook and worked in several restaurants in Italy. I married an Italian, and spent seven years in Italy, before I put my foot down and said I was ready to move back to the States. He came for a year, but was missing Italy. We decided to compromise, and also to have kids. 
	We now have two little children, and live half the year in Italy and half in Philadelphia. This makes for an interesting life, but makes working as a chef difficult. After weighing my options for a long time, I finally decided that if I was going to make a career change away from cooking, I would really like to dive further into the world of computers, and software development.  So far I love my decision.

Back in October a good friend of mine challenged me to do 100 workouts by the end of the year (challenge was not completed, but that's besides the point). He looked around for a way to keep track of our workouts, but couldn't find a good app. He made a spreadsheet instead, and then said a few things that he wished the spreadsheet would do. After an hour or so of messing around with it, I had set up a bunch of the things he had been hoping for. I also had an idea for my rails project. 

I did begin the project with the intention of their being interaction between users, but soon realized that I would have to stick with a more bare bones idea of the app, and just have challenges that you would be able to put on yourself. I have four models; a user, challenges, workouts, and a join table of challenge-workouts. It was interesting getting all of the realtionships set up.

I enjoyed doing the rails project, it only took three months. Eek! Between kids, illness, and an array of other things it has been a crazy winter. Even though it took awhile, I think that spending so much time on it helped me to really begin to understand the ins and outs of rails...so powerful! 

My biggest snag in the project was intergrating bootstrap into rails. It took me a bit to get that set-up and then I had alot of trouble figuring out how bootstrap works with helpers in the views. I especially had trouble getting it to work with link_to. Eventually I found that adding the class name directly inside the link_to worked.

Now that it is spring, and I will have more time to study, I am looking forward to the next stage of the program!
